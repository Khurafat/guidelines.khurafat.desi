# Going Live

When a project moves from development to production, we need to go through numerous steps to get it ready for real world usage. We keep these steps in a checklist, which is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/Khurafat/project-launch-checklist).

> **NOTE:** This is a general purpose checklist, there can be several other steps involved depending on project type. It's highly recommended to copy this list to your project as `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` and any other measures needed accordingly.
